The punishment system for those dirty rule breakers:
1st: Warning.
2nd: 5-minute timeout + Prisoner.
3rd: Hour timeout.
4th: Kicked from server.
5th: Week timeout.
6th: Banned from server.
A "streak" will be kept for the rules you've broken. A streak resets after 14 days of no rules broken. If you have been improperly punished or feel that you could behave better now, you may appeal to any Leader.

Rules:
1. Be as family-friendly as possible.
2. Don't to things in the wrong channel. For example, using bots in general.
3. Anyone who can ping everyone isn't allowed to do so durring 10:00 pm through 8:30 AM.

    - Unnecessary criminal punishment.
    - Changing their nickname.
    - Unwanted haircuts
5. No spam pinging.
6. Don't blackmail.
7. Don't abuse bots. For example, don't give or make yourself an administrator role. If caught, punishment may vary.
